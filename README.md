# An Introduction to Scientific Coding with Python 3 and Git
Welcome to scientific coding! Everything is fine.


## Overview
This short course is targeted at students and scientists looking to get started with scientific programming. It assumes little to no programming experience!

We will cover a range of topics like basic command line navigation, collaboration with Git, basic Python scripting and sharing reproducible code with Jupyter notebooks.

This course recommends two short online courses to be completed concurrently with the lessons (see the schedule of pre-class homework in the [Syllabus](#syllabus) below). Those courses are [Learn Git][learn-git] (approx. 1-2 hrs) and [Learn Python][learn-python] (approx. 8-10 hrs). If you are following along weekly, I would budget about 1 hr per week for the in class lessons and 1-2 hrs per week for the pre-class homework.

Both of the homework courses are offered for free on [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/) (you will need to sign up for a Codecademy account).

## Syllabus

|[0](./lessons/lesson0) | Terminal navigation, bash basics, permissions, installing Anaconda | N/A |
|[1](./lessons/lesson1) | Git, GitHub, licenses | [Learn Git][learn-git] 1-4 |
|[2](./lessons/lesson2) | Jupyter, strings, indexing, booleans, ifs  | [Learn Python][learn-python] 1-3 |
|[3](./lessons/lesson3) | Numpy, matplotlib, functions, methods, lists, dictionaries | [Learn Python][learn-python] 4-5 |
|[4](./lessons/lesson4) | Conda environments, scipy, pandas, loops, comprehensions | [Learn Python][learn-python] 6-9 |
|[5](./lessons/lesson6) | Putting it all together | [Learn Python][learn-python] 10-12 |

The Learn Git course can be found at https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git.

The Learn Python course can be found at https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python.

These are both free courses, but Codecademy will try to get you to pay for extra stuff. You only need your free account to do these 2 courses, i.e. *don't pay for stuff!*
