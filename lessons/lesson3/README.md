# Lesson 3
Today's lesson is an overview of **Objects**, **Classes**, **Lists**, **Tuples**, **Sets**, and **Dictionaries**. One of the most important choices to make when working with data in Python is how to store that data. We will be exploring this idea in the interactive Jupyter notebooks below. They can be accessed in the `/sci_coding/lessons/lesson3/data/` directory if you have forked the repository and have a local Jupyter server working. Otherwise, they can be done online via the `mybinder.org` links below.

As always, let me know if you have any questions! The homework for next week is [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) modules 6-9. We will cover loops and delve into managing packages in Anaconda.
