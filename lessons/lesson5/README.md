# Lesson5: Wrapping it all up!
In this lesson, we will learn by doing! We will put our foundations of Git, Python and Jupyter to the test to improve a demo scientific coding library on GitHub.

## The Task
A demo repository called [plutopy](https://github.com/cjtu/plutopy) has been made on GitHub. There are a number of *issues* open on GitHub with possible enhancements, features and bug fixes to work on. Your task is to become a plutopy contributor by installing the necessary packages locally with Anaconda and then choose one or more issues to fix to improve the package.

## The Repository
The purpose of plutopy is to analyze a global mosaic of Pluto's surface in Python. It will involve reading the image file into Python, reading in tables of data from CSV files, and analyzing these with scientific Python libraries. 

Several starter issues have been posted on the plutopy [issue tracker](https://github.com/cjtu/plutopy/issues), but you are also welcome to write your own issues for any features that you would like to work on! The intent of this lesson is to learn a new package or coding technique that you are interested in, while practicing Git and GitHub. The [Submitting your first pull request issue](https://github.com/cjtu/plutopy/issues/1) will familiarize you with the repository and the GitHub workflow that you will use to write your code. After that, you may choose to contribute to the repo however you'd like!

## Thank you!
Thanks for joining for this whirlwind 6 weeks. I hope you can take something you learned on to improve your science, coding, or both. I would greatly appreciate your feedback in case I decide to run this again, so please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions sometime after the lesson. 

Finally, if you develop any questions about Python, Git, or open-source I'm happy to be a resource! Helping create quality reproducable science is one of my favorite things to do, so please reach out!
